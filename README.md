<h1><center>"INTRODUCTION ABOUT HTML"</h1></center>

<h3>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.</h3>

<h1><b><center>"HTML APPLICATION."<b></h1></center>

<h3>An HTML Application (HTA; file extension ".hta") is a Microsoft Windows application that uses HTML and Dynamic HTML in a browser to provide the application's graphical interface. A regular HTML file is confined to the security model of the web browser's security, communicating only to web servers and manipulating only web page objects and site cookies. An HTA runs as a fully trusted application and therefore has more privileges, like creation/editing/removal of files and Windows Registry entries. Because they operate outside the browser's security model, HTAs cannot be executed via HTTP, but must be downloaded (just like an EXE file) and executed from local file system.</h3>

<h1>WHY I LEARN HTML?</h1>

<h3>HTML is the foundation of all web pages. Without HTML, you wouldnâ€™t be able to organize text or add images or videos to your web pages. HTML is the beginning of everything you need to know to create engaging web pages!</h3>
